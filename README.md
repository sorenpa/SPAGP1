# SPAGP1
SPAGP1 is short for Soren Peter Andersen Game Project 1 (very creative)

This project is for my own personal interest, and thus not meant for distribution. This repository is public and the code is free to 
download and use.

The plan for this project is to create a client/server solution for one of my favorite games Dark Age of Camelot. The current plan is to
use:
- UE4 for handling the client graphics (www.unrealengine.com)
- Dawn of Light open source DAoC server emulator (http://www.dolserver.net/)

This repository will not contain any code from these external parts fo my project.
